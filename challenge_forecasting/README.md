Interview Problem Data Science Team
===================================

### Task 

The goal of this test is forecast the electric consumption of an office building in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Attached is an extract from two tables:
- hourly consumption : https://raw.github.com/lpoirier/interview/master/challenge_forecasting/OfficeSouthBay_data.csv
- weather info : https://raw.github.com/lpoirier/interview/master/challenge_forecasting/OfficeSouthBay_weather.csv

Please have a look and build a forecast for the last month (december) of 2012.

### Requirements

1.  Perform the analysis and submit your __code__ and a __quick explanation of your analysis__ (a few pages).
2.  Code can be written in Python, R, Ruby, Java, MatLab, please avoid commercial statistical languages such as SAS, STATA, etc. as they may require a license.
3.  You need to document your code with enough details so a software engineer can navigate it without asking you questions.

### Tips

1.  This is a coding interview as well as a data science one, so make sure your coding skills shine.
2.  Data is a bit dirty, contains gaps, and dates are shifted because of time zone so be a bit careful. ;)
3.  Units are US System (Fahrenheit, precipitation = inches, solar = W/ft^2) and consumption is in kWh.
4.  In the explanation, it would be wise to briefly describe the technique you used (and what led you to pick that one), your performance metrics (MAPE, RMSE, etc.), potential sources of error,.
5.  Ideas of how to exploit your findings for new products, limitations to your approach, external data sources you would like to use, or anything to fill the gap between a prototype and a deployed product are good comments to put in the explanation.
6.  This test is not intended to take you more than a few hours.
