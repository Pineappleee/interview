Interview Problem Data Science Team
===================================

### Task 

The goal of this test is to build a forecast of the electricity consumption of an office building in San Francisco Bay Area.
Attached is an extract from different tables (hourly consumption data and weather)
Please build a forecast for the last month of 2012.

A few ideas of questions (not mandatory nor exhaustive):
- building operation characteristics
- what are the main drivers of consumption
- existence of solar / wind generators or electric vehicle loads
- etc.

### Requirements

1.  Perform the analysis and submit your __code__ and a __quick explanation__ (a few pages) to the recruiter 
2.  Code can be written in Python, R, Ruby, Java, MatLab, please avoid commercial statistical languages such as SAS, STATA, etc. (no license for them)
3.  You need to document your code with enough details so a software engineer can navigate without asking you questions.

### Tips

1.  This is a coding interview as well as a data science one, so make sure your coding skills shine
2.  Data is a bit dirty, contains gaps, and dates are shifted because of time zone so be a bit careful ;)
3.  Units are US System (Fahrenheit, precipitation = inches, solar = W/ft^2),  consumption is in kWh.
4.  In the explanation, it would be wise to briefly describe the technique you used (and what led you to pick that one), your performance metrics, etc.
5.  Ideas of how to exploit your findings for new products, limitations to your approach, external data sources you would like to use, or anything to fill the gap between a prototype and a deployed product, are good comments to put in the explanation
