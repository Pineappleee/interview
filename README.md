Interview Problem Data Science Team
===================================

### Task 

The purpose of this test is to analyze 

Attached is a dataset for an office (full building) in San Francisco Bay Area

It contains a raw extract from different tables (hourly consumption data and weather)

Units are US units (Fahrenheit, precipitation = inches, solar = W/ft^2),  consumption is in kWh.

I would like you to have a look at it and figure out what information you can get out of it (I am sure you have other things to do / other interviews, so don't spend more than a few hours on it).
A few ideas of questions:
- building operation characteristics
- what are the main drivers of consumption
- existence of solar / wind generators or electric vehicle loads
â€¦ or whatever you can come up with.

I would like you to send me your code (any language is fine) and maybe a quick explanation of your findings on or before Thursday October 22.
If you have ideas on how to exploit this information for new products, limitations to your approach, external data sources you would like to use, whatever, these are good comments to put in the explanation.
We'll schedule a call for Friday October 23, so you can present me (and tentatively a PM) your findings.



### Tips

1.  This is a coding interview as well as a data science one, so make sure your coding skills shine
2.  Data are shifted because of time zone so be a bit careful ;)
3.  


### Basic code requirements

1.  Code can be written in Python, R, Ruby, Java, MatLab, please avoid statistical languages such as SAS, STATA, etc.
2.  You need to document your code with enough details so a software engineer can navigate without asking you questions.
